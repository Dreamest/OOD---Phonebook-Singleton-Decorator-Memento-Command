A follow up on the previous phonebook project.

This time, implmentation of some design patterns:
Singleton - to limit the amount of new windows.
Decorator - There are two types of windows, designed by a decorator.
Memento - Allows undo/redo features.
Command - To allow easier methodology for buttons usage.
